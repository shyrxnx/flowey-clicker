# 🌻 Flowey Clicker

Flowey Clicker is a small React clicker game inspired by Flowey from **Undertale**.


## 🎮 How to Play

- Click Flowey to earn points.  
- Buy **Click Upgrades** to make each click stronger.  
- Buy **Auto Clickers** to automatically gain points every second.  
- The price of  Clicker and Auto Clickers goes up the more you have.  
- There’s **no save feature yet**, so if you refresh the page, your progress resets.



## 🧠 Tech Used

- **React** (with `useState` and `useEffect`)  
- Basic CSS for styling  



## 🧩 How to Run It

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flowey-clicker.git
   cd flowey-clicker
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).



## ⚠️ Notes

* No data persistence yet — refreshing the page will reset everything.
* This is just a fun project to learn React and experiment with game logic.

## 🌸 Credits

* **Flowey** and all related imagery belong to *Toby Fox*, creator of **Undertale**.


## ✨ Ideas for Future Updates

* Add localStorage saving
* Add sounds and animations
* Add more upgrades and UI polish
* Maybe add music?
